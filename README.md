# Workshop: Get started with security for your Java Microservices application

Dieser Workshop dient als Übung für meine Vorlesung "Verteilte Systeme" an der Dualen Hochschule Baden-Württemberg (DHBW) in Stuttgart.

This workshop serves as an exercise for my lecture "Distributed Systems" at the Cooperative State University Baden-Wuerttemberg (DHBW) in Stuttgart.

This workshop is an adaptation of the IBM Workshop [Get started with security for your Java Microservices application](https://ibm-developer.gitbook.io/get-started-with-security-for-your-java-microservi/).

The IBM Workshop uses preprovisioned Kubernetes clusters on the IBM Cloud based on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS).

This version of the workshop is based on [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) running on your own workstation.
